;;; Commentary:
;;
;; compile-bookmarks.el allows you to bookmark your compile commands and retain
;; them across sessions.
;;
;; When you enable the global `compile-bookmarks-mode', your bookmarks will be
;; loaded from `compile-bm-save-file'.  If you quit emacs with the mode enabled,
;; the bookmarks will be stored automatically.
;;
;; You can manage your bookmarks with `compile-bm-add', `compile-bm-remove' and
;; `compile-bm-recompile', or use the "Compile" menu.
;;
;; Keys can be assigned to bookmarks as well.  All keybindings are added to
;; `compile-bm-shortcut-map', which is bound to C-c <f8> by default.
;; To change this prefix key, you can add the following to you .emacs:
;;
;; (define-key compile-bookmarks-mode-map (kbd "C-c <f5>")
;;             compile-bm-shortcut-map)
;;
